        Full-stack developer who lives for the challenge of connecting React
        frontends with Node.js backends to create seamless user experiences.
        Passionate about real-time applications and scalable web architecture.
        Through 3+ years of intensive CCBP 4.0 training, I've built live polling
        platforms with MongoDB persistence, movie apps with API integrations,
        and task managers with local storage. I love diving deep into REST APIs,
        state management, and deployment workflows. Currently exploring advanced
        React patterns, authentication flows, and real-time data visualization.
        Always experimenting with the latest tools to build faster, more
        intuitive web applications.
